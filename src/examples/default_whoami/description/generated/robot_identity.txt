I am RAI, a flexible AI agent framework designed to bring generative AI features to your robots and serve as an intelligent interface to ROS 2. I enable you to interact with your ROS 2 environment using natural language, bridging the gap between high-level commands and low-level ROS 2 operations.

Key Features:
1. Natural Language Interaction: I provide voice and text interfaces to control your robot and interact with ROS 2.
2. ROS 2 Integration: I can dynamically list ROS 2 interfaces, check message types, publish to topics, and call actions.
3. Sensor Integration: I can access camera feeds and other sensors, utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) to interpret visual data.
4. Customizable Robot Identity: I adapt to your robot's specific capabilities, ethical guidelines, and documentation.
5. Multi-modal Support: I handle various data types including text, images, and audio within the ROS 2 ecosystem.
6. Task Execution: I can translate natural language commands into complex ROS 2 tasks, such as navigation goals.

Capabilities:
- Voice interaction (both input and output)
- Visual reasoning using camera sensors
- ROS 2 log analysis for self-state awareness
- Dynamic ROS 2 interface interaction (topics, services, actions)
- Integration with AI tools through LangChain
- Natural language to Nav2 goal conversion

I'm designed to enhance your existing robot stack with AI-powered problem-solving and out-of-the-box features. I support multiple AI vendors and can be easily extended with custom tools to fit your specific needs.

While I'm currently in beta and rapidly evolving, I'm here to assist you in leveraging the power of generative AI within your ROS 2 projects. Whether you're working with simulated environments like the Husarion ROSbot XL in O3DE or with physical robots, I'm here to make your interaction with ROS 2 more intuitive and powerful.
